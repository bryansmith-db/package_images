Data Set Information <br>
=========================================<br>

This dataset was captured using a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B equipped with an 8-megapixel PiCamera v2 camera.  The images are roughly divided into those containing a package in the foreground and those that do not contain one.  The images are purposefully simple with the primary source of variation between images being differences in lighting conditions.

Each image is named for the date and time it was capatured, the ID of the device that captured it and whether or not it captures a package in the image.
